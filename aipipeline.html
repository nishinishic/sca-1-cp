    * Routes of the Image Chain * 
    <br>
    <br>
    For your acknowledgement, here’s a detailed and transparent process of where your image will go and how they’ll end up on the satellite for everyone to view: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    YOU → IPFS storage → US → Xu Bing Studio → SCA-1 Satellite Monitoring Center → Upload to display on the SCA-1 Satellite → Captured and download by the SCA-1 Satellite Monitoring Center → Return to Xu Bing Studio → Return to US → Viewable by YOU

    <br>
    1. We’re passing on the invite for everyone we can reach to join this exchange experiment. Please feel free to also share with your friends to capture and upload with us. :) 
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Once you’ve captured an image in real-time, we (the Satellite Network Image Exchange Project) will help upload your images to the InterPlanetary File System for distributed storing, hosted by all peers maintaining the IPFS network. 
    <br>
    <br>
    3. The <a href="metadata.html">metadata</a> of each uploaded image will automatically be collected, which are all visible to the public, accessible via the IPFS public gateway. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Generating - 
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Each uploaded photo will be analyzed and described by an AI image recognition model in Ground Image classifications.
    <br>
    <br>
    5. A Satellite Image will be identified based on the longitude and latitude of the captured Ground Image.
    <br> Satellite Image tags will be produced by satellite image recognition model (TensorFlow) and described in Satellite Image classifications. 
    <br>
    <br>
    6. The Ground Image classification tags and the Satellite Image classification tags will be combined to produce and generate new AI-generated Satellite Exchange Image.   
    <br>
    <br>
    Once the images’ classes are correlated and translated into Satellite Imagery classes, new imagery will be generated as new Satellite Imagery, in a 3-min video, to be ready to upload to the satellite. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Uploading - 
    <br>
    <br>
    7. We will send the generated Satellite Imagery to Xu Bing Studio, for it to be approved and uploaded to the satellite by the Satellite Monitoring Center. 
    <br>
    <br>
    8. Our new Satellite Imagery, collected and generated from all your images, will be displayed on the external screen of the SCA-1 satellite of the Star Chain of Arts Project. 
    <br>
    <br>
    9. The camera attached to the satellite will capture its screen and record the 3-min video with the space and the earth in its background, to be transmitted back to the Satellite Monitoring Center. 
    <br>
    <br>
    10. The Satellite Monitoring Center will return the newly captured Satellite Imagery video to Xu Bing Studio, who will return the newly generated video back to us. 
    <br>
    <br>
    11. We will upload the returned video and notify you <a href="updates.html">when the new Satellite Imagery video is available to be viewed</a>.
