      * from “People’s Images" in exchange for "Satellite Network Imagery” *
      <br>
      <br>
      This web-based project invites people to capture and upload images of "the World they See" in hope to send to Space to be viewable by the public. Collected People’s Images, stored on 
      <a href="https://ipfs.tech/" target="_blank">IPFS</a>, 
      along with their metadata, will be used to exchange for satellite imagery in a graph of the Image Chain and other geopolitical, energy, and climate information between the People and the Satellite, ultimately to be displayed on the screen of the satellite SCA-1
      (<a href="https://www.n2yo.com/?s=58924&live=1" target="_blank">NORAD ID 58924</a>) until it’s transmitted back for People’s viewing.     
      <br>
      <br>
      This is a commissioned and collaborative work for the <a href="http://global.cafa.edu.cn/infoDetail/1/324" target="_blank">Star Chain of Arts Project</a> at the <a href="https://www.xubing.com/en/work/details/718?year=2024&type=year" target="_blank">Xu Bing Space Art Residency Program</a>.

      <br>
      For your acknowledgement, here’s a detailed and transparent process of where your image will go and how it will end up on the satellite for everyone to view: 
      <br>
      <br>
      YOUR IMAGE → (via this project webpage) → IPFS storage → 
      <br> collected by the Satellite Network Image Exchange Project → Xu Bing Studio → 
      <br> SCA-1 Satellite Monitoring Center → Upload to display on the SCA-1 Satellite → 
      <br> Captured and downloaded by the SCA-1 Satellite Monitoring Center → Returned to Xu Bing Studio → 
      <br> Returned to the Satellite Network Image Exchange Project → 
      <br> Viewable by YOU      
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      We’re passing on the invite for everyone we can reach to join this exchange experiment. Please feel free to also share with your friends to capture and upload with us. :)
